This program uses IPV4 internet sockets to make a client/server connection

Server or client is specifiec by a command line argument

./assignment8 server
    This will spin up a server on port 49999 that waits for a client connection
    When a connection is received, the server forks off a new child process to handle the connection
    It then logs the hostname of the client and the number of times a client has connected to stdout
    and writes the current date and time to the client (as text) via the socket connection

./assignment8 client address
    This will create a client that attempts to connect to the specified address
    When the client connects to the server, it will write the date it recieved to stdout
    The output is exactly 18 bytes plus an additional newline (for a total of 19 bytes)
    Example:"Wed Apr  1 12:30:2\n"
