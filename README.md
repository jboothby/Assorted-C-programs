# Assorted C programs
Various program written in C that demonstrate proficiency.

FTP System:
 A File Transfer Protocol system that uses Linux system calls, IPv4 web sockets, pipes, I/O redirection,
 and Multi-Process execution. Designed on the server/client model. Allows client to view files on server,
 transfer files to/from server, and traverse the server file tree.

Multi-threaded Quick Sort:
 A version of Quick Sort that uses multiple threads to speed up execution. Out-performs C's qsort
 Performance improves with additional threads

Counting Word Pairs using Hashtable Open Chaining:
 Shows implementation of a Hashtable from scratch using Linked List open chaining and dynamic resizing.

Recursive File Enumeration:
 Uses Linux system calls to recursively walk a file tree and count the number of regular files

Dining Philosophers using Semaphores:
 Example of using Semaphores to signal concurrent threads when a resource is available

Dining Philosophers using Mutexes:
 Example of how to use Mutexes to protect shared resources to avoid deadlock/livelock between threads

Binary Search:
 This program uses system calls like lseek, open, and read to implement a binary
 search on a dictionary file with known width without reading more than a single
 line of the file into memory at a time.
 
P6 (Hashtable Implemntation)
 This program shows a basic hashtable implentation with static size of buckets
 and methods for search, insert, delete, empty, etc..

P9 (Adjacency Matrix)
 This program implements a breadth-first search of a directed graph using
 an adjacency matrix.

BubbleSort
 This program implements a simple bubble sort on an array of structs
